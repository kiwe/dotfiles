My VIM configuration. You may use it, free of charge.

## Installation

Clone it to your home directory

```
git clone https://github.com/kiwe/vim.git ~/.vim
```

Setup a symlink to the vimrc file

```
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
```

Initialize the submodules

```
cd ~/.vim
git submodule update --init
```

You're done. You might also want to install some
[powerline fonts](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts) on your system
so that vim-airline looks extra fancy.

Happy coding!
